# Brain-Stroke-Prediction-System
The Brain Stroke Prediction System uses machine learning to predict stroke risk based on health factors like age, hypertension, heart disease, and more. This project preprocesses data, trains models, and evaluates them using accuracy, precision, and recall, aiming to assist in early stroke detection.
